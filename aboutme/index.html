    <p>Hello friends,</p>
    <p>My name is Vitor and I'm 21 years old. I'm Brazilian and live in Franca-SP and returned from my mission <br>
    in Natal-RN. I got married 4 months ago to my best friend. I have a lot of hobbies, but my favorite ones <br>
    are playing sports such as basketball and soccer. I'm a member of the church since I was born and always loved the gospel. <br>
    My father did BYU Pathway too and finished his degree while I was on a mission. I could see all his enjoyment and <br>
    excitement in being able to study. He inspired me to do it too. Currently, I work in the programming area, <br>
    but I write programs for electrical EDM machines. I use a totally different language code to do the operations, <br>
    but I found out that I really like programming, and I'm sure this course will be awesome. </I></p>
    <p>Thank you all for reading, and hope we can work together and help each other. </p>
